IMPORTANT LESSONS TO REMEMBER FROM THIS SECTION!!!!

1. "git status" will tell you if you're working with any differences from your last COMMIT
NOT the latest version/push (afaik)

2. "git add" adds files to the sTAGING AREA which you can check by typing "git status"
to check. to add ALL files in the working directory, type "git add ."

3. 'git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"' COMMITS all the changes to your local REPOSITORY to be
PUSHED later.

4. "git push" PUSHES all COMMITS to the github REPOSITORY for approval.
THE ODIN PROJECT MENTIONS "git push origin main" because quote: "Since you are not dealing
with another branch other than main, or a different remote as mentioned above, you don't
have to use that."

5. "git log" will print the log of your COMMITS since your last PUSH. TO SAVE THIS log
(or if it doesn't print the entire log, was only printing last 2 commits for me)
press the 's' key, then type a file name with the ".txt" extension to save the log
in the current working directory. When finished, quit with the 'q' key.

6. "git clone /.SSH URL HERE./" is a command that clones the github REPOSITORY to your
current working directory using GIT (not github)

7. "git remote -v" displays the github URL of the repository in your current WD.
