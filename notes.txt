NOT the latest version/push (afaik)

2. "git add" adds files to the sTAGING AREA which you can check by typing "git status"
to check. to add ALL files in the working directory, type "git add ."

3. 'git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"' COMMITS all the changes to your local REPOSITORY to be
PUSHED later.

4. "git push" PUSHES all COMMITS to the github REPOSITORY for approval.
